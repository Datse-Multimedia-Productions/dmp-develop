This is the roadmap for the main DMP Develop Project.   The following components are planned:

* Base --- This provides the front view, and keeps track of installed components.
* Admin --- This provides any administration features including creating and updating other components, and the database for each of the components. 
  * This will provide the basic hooks which will be called for any of the administrative features which are called by other components.
  * We will need to define things better for this.
* Privilages --- This will take care of anything which has any kind of privilage settings.
* Users --- This will manage any of the user creation/deletion/modification issues.
* Profile --- This will provide access to profile information for any user.

* Time Tracking --- This tracks time for projects.
* Project Management --- Provide the ability to manage projects (including itself).
* Issue Tracking --- Provide the ability to track issues, primarilly within a project, but that might be something else.

The following componets we have some form in progress (note we only remove a component from "in progress" if it gets moved to "depricated", "reatired" or "obsolete"):

* Base 
  * This is currently on GitHub and the current version is up to date.
  * It does not currently provide anything which allows seeing what other installed componets exist.
* Users
  * This is also on on GitHub.  
  * Very little has been done here.  
* Fun
  * We have a little bit of work on this.  There is one component.

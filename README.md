# dmp-develop
information about the larger DMP Develop project.

## Components with work being done on them:

* [Base](https://github.com/Datse-Multimedia-Productions/dmp-develop-base) — The base which everything else runs off of.  
* [Users](https://github.com/Datse-Multimedia-Productions/dmp-develop-users) — User Management.
* [Issues](https://github.com/Datse-Multimedia-Productions/dmp-develop-issues) — Issue Tracker.
* [Fun](https://github.com/Datse-Multimedia-Productions/dmp-develop-fun) — Stuff to play with. Just some fun stuff, right now only one little toy in there.

### Base

The base setup will handle a few different things:

* Installation of database
* Installation of other components
* Tracking of components
  * This will likely at least partially be moved to another component as things get more complex, though "required" components may end up continuing to be tracked here
* Providing the base to communicate between components
 
### Users

* This will manage users
 
### Issues

* Will handle issue tracking.

### Fun

* Just little fun things.  Currently only has one little toy in it.
